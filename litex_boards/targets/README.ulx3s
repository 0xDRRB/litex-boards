USB
===
USB support has been integrated and tested for V3.0.3 this board. Revisions
higher than this should be supported. The USB connection is on US2.

To build with usb support just do;

./ulx3s.py --uart-name=usb_cdc

The USB Serial connection will appear as /dev/ttyACMx, or equivalent on your OS.
